            <div>The objective of our Vehicle Detection using Cascade Classifier (VDCC) based on Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features project is to detect object of interest (vehicles) in video frames. It combines best practices from real-time image processing and pattern recognition techniques of images captured from an image sensor (camera). Our strategy is to combine a well-established HOG detector with Cascade classifier to train our model using the provided testData and eliminate instances of false detections that do not match our learned motor vehicle detection model.</div>

The main objective of Adaptive Cruise Control Using LIDAR project is to enable the cruise control system used in road vehicles to automatically slow down or speed up the vehicle up to a speed limit set by the driver. The result is improved driver's comfort, and safety of the vehicle and other traffic on the road by minimizing rear-end collisions.</div>

The assumption is that the array of microphones should be receiving the same auditory signals but at different intervals of time. The sound captured by an array of microphones will be sampled.

        <h2 class="mb-5">Interests</h2>
        <p>Apart from being an embedded systems and software developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid skier and novice ice climber. During the warmer months here in Indiana, I enjoy mountain biking, free climbing, and kayaking.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the embedded systems and autonomous vehicle world.</p>

            <div class="subheading mb-3">Director of IT Infrastructure and Support at Renovo Solutions</div>
            <div>"Priyank is truly an incredible person both professionally and personally. His work ethic during our several years working together was nothing short of stellar. He received nothing but exceptional feedback from others that worked with him and even when dropped into unique and undefined roles, he had unrelenting ability to simply tackle whatever was asked of him. I see no limitations in where he can go. I am inspired by his quest to continue to grow and learn and I am very excited for his future and anyone lucky enough to work with him." - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/priyankkalgaonkar">LinkedIn Recommendations</a>.

            <div>"Priyank was instrumental in the early phases of Renovo Solutions Integrated Systems Management project at Beebe Healthcare in Lewes, Delaware. This project focuses on identification of networked medical devices, capturing system configuration, assessing system risk and working in conjunction with Beebe Healthcare’s IT Department to mitigate existing risks and establish policies and procedures to minimize future risk. The efforts at Beebe were recognized in 2018 by the Association for Advancement of Medical Instrumentation through their Clinical Solutions Award. Priyank accepted and eagerly took to the task of capturing all of the system configuration data, a very large task that was completed accurately and efficiently. Priyank is clearly an example of someone who will perform any given task to the best of his ability with exceptional results. Throughout his years at Renovo Solutions, he has always performed to this level, receiving high praise from Renovo Solutions management throughout the country. I can do nothing but highly recommend Priyank." - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/priyankkalgaonkar">LinkedIn Recommendations</a>.
