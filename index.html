            <div>The objective of our Vehicle Detection using Cascade Classifier (VDCC) based on Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features project is to detect object of interest (vehicles) in video frames. It combines best practices from real-time image processing and pattern recognition techniques of images captured from an image sensor (camera). Our strategy is to combine a well-established HOG detector with Cascade classifier to train our model using the provided testData and eliminate instances of false detections that do not match our learned motor vehicle detection model.</div>

            <div>The design of Adaptive Cruise Control system uses two microcontroller units, a Garmin LIDAR module which is compact and high-performance optical distance measurement sensor, and Brushless DC (BLDC) electric motor. The main objective of Adaptive Cruise Control Using LIDAR project is to enable the cruise control system used in road vehicles to automatically slow down or speed up the vehicle up to a speed limit set by the driver. The result is improved driver's comfort, and safety of the vehicle and other traffic on the road by minimizing rear-end collisions.</div>

            <div>Our prototype utilizes an array of microphones pointing in different directions and LED bulbs to display the direction of travel of emergency vehicles. The assumption is that the array of microphones should be receiving the same auditory signals but at different intervals of time. The sound captured by an array of microphones will be sampled. It will then be filtered and angle of the receiving sound-wave that corresponds to the frequency of the emergency vehicles’ sirens will be used to determine the direction of the corresponding sound-wave and light up the LEDs accordingly.

          <p>Apart from being an embedded systems and software developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. During the warmer months here in Indiana, I enjoy mountain biking, free climbing, and kayaking.</p>
          <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors, I like to watch sci-fi and sitcom genre movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the embedded systems and autonomous vehicle world.</p>

            <div>By working collaboratively in a team of five, we achieved following milestones in 96 hours:
              <br>• Researched and developed an Android UI/UX framework, and proposed the use of a toll-free number for marginalized urban and rural population in India to pick up ration in a slot-based system to prevent crowding and community level COVID transmission.
              <br>• Developed predictive modeling prototype built into the Android app to collect data on demand of ration and toll-free number users to estimate rations needs per region based in real-time data.
              <br>• Proposed further uses cases such as the predictive modeling system to estimate ration demand during unusual circumstances like natural calamities and pandemics.

            <p>In this paper, we demonstrate the implementation of our ultra-efficient deep convolutional neural network architecture: CondenseNeXt on NXP BlueBox, an autonomous driving development platform developed for self-driving vehicles. We show that CondenseNeXt is remarkably efficient in terms of FLOPs, designed for ARM-based embedded computing platforms with limited computational resources and can perform image classification without the need of a CUDA enabled GPU.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we propose a neoteric variant of deep convolutional neural network architecture to ameliorate the performance of existing CNN architectures for real-time inference on embedded systems with constrained computational resources. We show that our architecture, named CondenseNeXt, based on PyTorch framework is remarkably efficient in comparison to the baseline neural network architecture, CondenseNet, by reducing trainable parameters and FLOPs required to train the network whilst maintaining a balance between the trained model size of less than 3.0 MB and accuracy trade-off resulting in an unprecedented computational efficiency.</p>

            <div>"Priyank was instrumental in the early phases of Renovo Solutions Integrated Systems Management project at Beebe Healthcare in Lewes, Delaware. This project focuses on identification of networked medical devices, capturing system configuration, assessing system risk and working in conjunction with Beebe Healthcare’s IT Department to mitigate existing risks and establish policies and procedures to minimize future risk. The efforts at Beebe were recognized in 2018 by the Association for Advancement of Medical Instrumentation through their Clinical Solutions Award. Priyank accepted and eagerly took to the task of capturing all of the system configuration data, a very large task that was completed accurately and efficiently. Priyank is clearly an example of someone who will perform any given task to the best of his ability with exceptional results. Throughout his years at Renovo Solutions, he has always performed to this level, receiving high praise from Renovo Solutions management throughout the country. I can do nothing but highly recommend Priyank." - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/priyankkalgaonkar" target="_blank">LinkedIn Recommendation</a>.
