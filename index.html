            <div>The objective of our Vehicle Detection using Cascade Classifier (VDCC) based on Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features project is to detect object of interest (vehicles) in video frames. It combines best practices from real-time image processing and pattern recognition techniques of images captured from an image sensor (camera). Our strategy is to combine a well-established HOG detector with Cascade classifier to train our model using the provided testData and eliminate instances of false detections that do not match our learned motor vehicle detection model.</div>

            <div class="subheading mb-3">Purdue Univerisity</div>
            <div>The design of Adaptive Cruise Control system uses two microcontroller units, a Garmin LIDAR module which is compact and high-performance optical distance measurement sensor, and Brushless DC (BLDC) electric motor. The main objective of Adaptive Cruise Control Using LIDAR project is to enable the cruise control system used in road vehicles to automatically slow down or speed up the vehicle up to a speed limit set by the driver. The result is improved driver's comfort, and safety of the vehicle and other traffic on the road by minimizing rear-end collisions.</div>

            <div class="subheading mb-3">Purdue Univerisity</div>
            <div>Our prototype utilizes an array of microphones pointing in different directions and LED bulbs to display the direction of travel of emergency vehicles. The assumption is that the array of microphones should be receiving the same auditory signals but at different intervals of time. The sound captured by an array of microphones will be sampled. It will then be filtered and angle of the receiving sound-wave that corresponds to the frequency of the emergency vehicles’ sirens will be used to determine the direction of the corresponding sound-wave and light up the LEDs accordingly.

            <div class="subheading mb-3">Purdue University</div>
            <p>This Masters Thesis presents a neoteric variant of a deep convolutional neural network architecture called CondenseNeXt, specifically designed for ARM-based embedded computing platforms with limited computational resources. CondenseNeXt is an improved version of CondenseNet, incorporating depthwise separable convolutions and group-wise pruning to reduce redundant elements without compromising network performance. Cardinality and class-balanced focal loss functions are introduced to alleviate the effects of pruning. Extensive analyses on benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet) are conducted using an ARM-based embedded computing platform, NXP BlueBox 2.0, for real-time image classification. CondenseNeXt achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant reductions in forward FLOPs and can efficiently perform image classification without a CUDA-enabled GPU support on ARM-based computing platforms.</p>

            <div>"Priyank is truly an incredible person both professionally and personally. His work ethic during our several years working together was nothing short of stellar. He received nothing but exceptional feedback from others that worked with him and even when dropped into unique and undefined roles, he had unrelenting ability to simply tackle whatever was asked of him. I see no limitations in where he can go. I am inspired by his quest to continue to grow and learn and I am very excited for his future and anyone lucky enough to work with him." - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/priyankkalgaonkar" target="_blank">LinkedIn Recommendation</a>.

            <div>"Priyank was instrumental in the early phases of Renovo Solutions Integrated Systems Management project at Beebe Healthcare in Lewes, Delaware. This project focuses on identification of networked medical devices, capturing system configuration, assessing system risk and working in conjunction with Beebe Healthcare’s IT Department to mitigate existing risks and establish policies and procedures to minimize future risk. The efforts at Beebe were recognized in 2018 by the Association for Advancement of Medical Instrumentation through their Clinical Solutions Award. Priyank accepted and eagerly took to the task of capturing all of the system configuration data, a very large task that was completed accurately and efficiently. Priyank is clearly an example of someone who will perform any given task to the best of his ability with exceptional results. Throughout his years at Renovo Solutions, he has always performed to this level, receiving high praise from Renovo Solutions management throughout the country. I can do nothing but highly recommend Priyank." - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/priyankkalgaonkar" target="_blank">LinkedIn Recommendation</a>.

            <div>"Priyank is a great team player and would be a great asset to any company. Priyank is a detail orientated individual and goes above and beyond when he is assigned a project.

I would have him on my team in a heartbeat." - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/priyankkalgaonkar" target="_blank">LinkedIn Recommendation</a>.
